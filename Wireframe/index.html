        <h2>README - Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, 
          what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.
          You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. 
          A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, 
          communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.
        </p>

          Carrefour Label example: Doing a pull request is for example: you work at carrefor and your manager asks you to change
          the lable of the rice package. You grab the rice package (source- Hack Your Future main branch), you fork it, then you clone it
          then you add the label, you keep commiting your changes, once is up to your liking you submit a pull request, that is like going
          to your manager and show him how you did the label (you do the PR from you working branch to the source branch). 
          If needed review, someone in charge will do it and let you know if good or not and what needs to be changed.

        <h2>Wireframe - Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine having a fresh new idea for a website, app, or dashboard, but no clue of how to start… 
          That’s why wireframes exist.

        <h2>Branch - Github</h2>
        <p>
          Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. 
          Each repository has a default branch and can have multiple branches. 
          You can merge one branch into another using a pull request.
