              <p>A README file's purpose is to serve as a central, accessible text document that introduces a project,
                explains its contents, and provides instructions for its use, helping users, developers, and future
                maintainers understand and effectively utilize a software project or dataset. It's a crucial piece of
                documentation that includes information like the project's purpose, installation and usage instructions,
                contribution guidelines, licensing details, and contact information, acting as an essential guide for
                new users and collaborators. </p>

            </header>
            <summary>
              <p>A wireframe is a simple, visual blueprint of a digital product (website, app, or software interface).
              </p>
              <p>Its key purposes are:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Define Structure:</b> Outlines the layout and placement of elements (e.g., buttons, text,
                  images).</li>
                <li><b>Clarify Functionality:</b> Shows how users interact with the interface (e.g., navigation, forms).
                </li>
                <li> <b>Save Time & Costs:</b> Quick and cheap to create, allowing early feedback and avoiding costly
                  changes later.</li>
                <li><b>Improve Communication:</b> Acts as a shared reference for designers, developers, and
                  stakeholders.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Focus on UX:</b> Ensures the design is user-friendly before adding visual details.
                  Guide Design: Serves as a foundation for adding colors, fonts, and visuals later.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Wireframes help teams align on functionality and layout early, ensuring a smoother design and
                development process.</p>

          <!-- What is a branch in Git? -->
          <article class="description__item">
            <header>

              <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
            </header>
            <summary>
              <p>A branch in Git is a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit in your project's history. It
                allows you to work on different versions of your code independently without affecting the main codebase.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>What is a Branch? </b>A branch is like a separate timeline for your project.
                  It lets you diverge from the main line of development to work on new
                  features, bug fixes, or experiments. Each branch represents a different version of your project.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Why Use Branches?</b>
                  Work on new features or fixes without breaking the main code.
                  Multiple team members can work on different tasks simultaneously.
                  Test new ideas safely. If something goes wrong, you can discard the branch without affecting the main
                  project.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>How Branches Work:</b> When you create a branch, Git creates a pointer to the current commit. As
                  you make changes and commit them, the branch pointer moves forward. You can switch between branches to
                  work on different tasks.
                </li>
              </ol>
