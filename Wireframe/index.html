        <h2>Purpose of a README file</h2>
        <p>
          README Files are a common way
          to document the contents and structure
          of a folder and/or a dataset 
          so that a researcher can locate the information they need.

        <h2>What is a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>A wireframe is the skeleton of your digital project.
           Think of it as the foundation for your website, app,
            or dashboard. It focuses on layout, and content placement 
            not on colors, fonts, or any visual polish.</p>

        <h2>What is a branch in git</h2>
        <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer
           to one of these commits.
          The default branch name in Git is master.
          As you start making commits, you're given a master branch 
          that points to the last commit you made.
