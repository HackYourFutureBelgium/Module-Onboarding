        <h2>Purpose of a README file</h2>
        <p>
          README Files are a common way
          to document the contents <br> and structure
          of a folder and/or a dataset <br>
          so that a researcher can locate the information they need.

        <h2>What is a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>A wireframe is the skeleton of your digital project.<br>
           Think of it as the foundation for your website, app,<br>
            or dashboard. It focuses on layout, and content placement <br> 
            not on colors, fonts, or any visual polish.</p>

        <h2>What is a branch in git</h2>
        <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer
          <br> to one of these commits.
          <br>The default branch name in Git is master.
          <br>As you start making commits, you're given a master branch 
          <br>that points to the last commit you made.
