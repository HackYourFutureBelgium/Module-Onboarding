        On this website, you will gain insights into three major concepts for early-career developers, 
        namely the README file, wireframes, and Git branches.

        <h3>What is a README File?</h3>
        <p>
            A README file is the first thing users see when they discover your project. 
            It acts as both an introduction and instruction manual, 
            explaining what the project does, how to install it, and how to use it. 
            Good README files include project description, installation steps, usage examples, 
            and contribution guidelines. They serve as essential documentation that helps others 
            understand and work with your code effectively.

        <h3>What is the Purpose of a Wireframe?</h3>
        <p>
            A wireframe is a simple, low-fidelity sketch that represents the skeletal structure
             of a website or application. It focuses on layout, content placement, 
             and functionality without getting distracted by colors or styling. 
             Wireframes help developers, designers, and stakeholders agree on the basic structure
            before investing time in detailed design and coding. 
            They serve as a blueprint for the final product.

        <h3>What is a Branch in Git?</h3>
        <p>
           In Git, a branch is an independent line of development that allows you to work
           on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. 
           Think of it as creating a copy of your project where you can experiment safely. 
           When your work is complete and tested, you can merge the branch back into the main 
           project. Branches enable collaborative development and help maintain stable, 
           production-ready code.
